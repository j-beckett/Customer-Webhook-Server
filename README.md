This is a quick low down on how this all works.




Note: Values keep showing up even though they aren't listed in the mapping object 'itemForDB'? I set defaults using the SET DEFAULT command in PGDB. Try looking there !

If you are testing with productClient.js , change req.body.data -> req.body!!!

this is around line 343. the very start of the post product endpoint.
